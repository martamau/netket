# CustomSampler
Custom Sampler, where transition operators are specified by the user.
 For the moment, this functionality is limited to transition operators which
 are sums of $$k$$-local operators:

 $$
 \mathcal{M}= \sum_i M_i
 $$

 where the move operators $$ M_i $$ act on an (arbitrary) subset of sites.

 The operators $$ M_i $$ are specified giving their matrix elements, and a list
 of sites on which they act. Each operator $$ M_i $$ must be real,
 symmetric, positive definite and stochastic (i.e. sum of each column and line is 1).

 The transition probability associated to a custom sampler can be decomposed into two steps:

 1. One of the move operators $$ M_i $$ is chosen with a weight given by the
 user (or uniform probability by default). If the weights are provided,
 they do not need to sum to unity.

 2. Starting from state
 $$ |n \rangle $$, the probability to transition to state
 $$ |m\rangle $$ is given by
 $$ \langle n| M_i | m \rangle $$.

## Class Constructor
Constructs a new ``CustomSampler`` given a machine and a list of local
stochastic move (transition) operators.

### Examples
Sampling from a RBM machine in a 1D lattice of spin 1/2

```python
>>> import netket as nk
>>>
>>> g=nk.graph.Hypercube(length=10,n_dim=2,pbc=True)
>>> hi=nk.hilbert.Spin(s=0.5,graph=g)
>>>
>>> # RBM Spin Machine
>>> ma = nk.machine.RbmSpin(alpha=1, hilbert=hi)
>>>
>>> # Construct a Custom Sampler
>>> # Using random local spin flips (Pauli X operator)
>>> X = [[0, 1],[1, 0]]
>>> move_op = nk.operator.LocalOperator(hilbert=hi,operators=[X] * g.n_sites,acting_on=[[i] for i in range(g.n_sites)])
>>> sa = nk.sampler.CustomSampler(machine=ma, move_operators=move_op)

```



## Class Methods 
### reset
Resets the state of the sampler, including the acceptance rate statistics
and optionally initializing at random the visible units being sampled.

| Argument  |   Type   |                  Description                  |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
|init_random|bool=False|If ``True`` the quantum numbers (visible units)|

### seed
Seeds the random number generator used by the ``Sampler``.

|Argument |Type|                 Description                 |
|---------|----|---------------------------------------------|
|base_seed|int |The base seed for the random number generator|

### sweep
Performs a sampling sweep. Typically a single sweep
consists of an extensive number of local moves.
