# Lattice
A generic lattice built translating a unit cell and adding edges between nearest neighbours sites.
 The unit cell is defined by the ``basis_vectors`` and it can contain an arbitrary number of atoms.
 Each atom is located at an arbitrary position and is labelled by an integer number,
 meant to distinguish between the different atoms within the unit cell.
 Periodic boundary conditions can also be imposed along the desired directions.
 There are three different ways to refer to the lattice sites. A site can be labelled
 by a simple integer number (the site index), by its coordinates (actual position in space),
 or by a set of integers (the site vector), which indicates how many
 translations of each basis vectors have been performed while building the
 graph. The i-th component refers to translations along the i-th ``basis_vector`` direction.

## Class Constructor
Constructs a new ``Lattice`` given its side length and the features of the unit cell.
